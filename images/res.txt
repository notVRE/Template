Dear TL Dyan Cabasaan,

I am writing to formally notify you of my resignation from the position of Financial Advisor I with Concentrix. Per my notice period, my final day will be January 17, 2025.

Following careful reflection, I have decided to step down from my role at Concentrix to move forward in a direction that aligns more closely with my professional aspirations.

I am thankful for the opportunities and experiences provided to me during my tenure at Concentrix. The valuable skills I have gained here are deeply appreciated and will undoubtedly benefit me in my ongoing professional journey.

In the coming weeks before January 17, 2025, I am fully committed to assisting in ensuring a smooth transition.

Sincerely,
